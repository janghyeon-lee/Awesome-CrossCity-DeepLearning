# Awesome-CrossCity-Trajectory-Modeling

This repository provides the latest and most comprehensive information on **Cross-City Trajectory Modeling**.

Cross-city trajectory modeling aims to predict and analyze movement patterns across multiple cities, leveraging diverse urban data to create models that generalize well beyond single-city boundaries. This approach is essential for applications like traffic forecasting and urban planning in cities lacking extensive historical data, enabling better resource allocation and emergency response across varied environments. However, challenges arise due to differing city layouts, cultural behaviors, and transportation networks, as well as inconsistencies in data quality.

Our repository aims to provide a foundation and tools for further research in cross-city trajectory modeling, encouraging experimentation with these methods to advance the field.
